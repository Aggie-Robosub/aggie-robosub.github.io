# Website Development Plan

This file is here to organize the documentation for our website.

Authors: Taylor Gebhard, 

# Requirements Analysis

The website must include the following as outlined by [the RoboSub Team Handbook](https://robonation.org/app/uploads/sites/4/2024/07/2024-RoboSub_Team-Handbook_v2.pdf):
- Currrent team name and contact information
- Vehicle photos and/or videos
- List of sponsors with logos
- Supporting media, which may include:
  - Instructional/Informative videos
  - Procedures (text,images)
  - Design decision documentation (text, imgaes, videos)
  - Blogs for historical records of build progress

Also, the website must ensure a good user experience since it will be the first impression of our project outside of the actual competition. 
These are some priorities we should strive to include in our implementation:
- Written in english
- Clear prioritization of key content
- Site search functionality
- Basic design elements: contrast, repetition, alignment and grouping to organize/highlight content
- User accessibility, as defined by the [W3C Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
- Cross browser compatibility for modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, MS Edge)
- A mobile friendly display

# Design

The website will be devided into several pages, which are navigable via a toolbar at the top of each page. The most notable page 
on the website will the the Current Project page, which will include information about things such as the development cycle and 
features of the submarine, and team member information. 

### Home Page

### Join the Team Page
The easiest way to get people to sign up is to use a google form, so that is what this page will be. Just a google form.

The information that the form requires is the following:
- email
- name
- phone number
- discord server link

Other information on this page will be our meeting time and place at USU, so that people who want to join know what our schedule is.

### Sponsor page
This page must include information about our sponsors, with their logos included. There really isn't much else to say about that.


### Current Project Page
We want to prioritize including much more information than previous teams who worked on this, since making the website now and 
trying to scrounge up information when there is none is super annoying. This page will include lots of detailed information about
specific elements of the current project. Here are some of the important aspects to be focused on:
- Submarine hardware and software features
- Development and testing cycle
- Competition requirements
- Team members

To make this page pretty, we have also decided to put related photos next to each sections' text. We thought it would look nice
if the image only took up about 1/3 of the space for each section, alternating between the left and right sides of the page to
give some more variety and make it more interesting. Any photos that do not fit on this page or are not needed will simply be 
put into the Image Gallery Page.

### Past Projects Page
We are not provided with very much information about the previous projects in the club. This means 
this page can't really do much more than include a summary and a photo of the previous iterations of the submarine. We only have 
one photo for each of the poseidon submarines, so this is pretty restrictive. 

Even with this restriction, the page should try to include information about each submarine such as when it was made, 
some things about the development process, or specific focuses that the team working on it had in mind.

### Image Gallery Page
This page will be a place on the website where we can just dump photos of many different things. It should be divided 
up based on 'eras' of the project, as we have some photo assets from previous years given to us. In other pages on the website, 
photos are included besides text to enhance the readers' experience, but this also restricts which kinds of photos we can include. 
It would be nice to have a page where this restriction does not apply, and we can upload all of our photos and have something really 
visual for the readers, since they can just navigate to specific pages for textual information anyway.

These are the 'eras' to be included:
- Poseidon Submarines
- Seahorse submarine
- Current project

Not having any textual information on the page at all doesn't take into consideration users which have not already familiarized 
themselves with our project on other pages. Furthermore, since this is a place where we can dump photos that are not included 
on the other pages anyway, we need some kind of way of describing the content displayed by photos. Here are some options:
- A left-to-right description underneath the photos from an 'era', similar to how yearbooks would describe photographs
- Some descriptive text underneath each photo, making each one look sort of like a polaroid that has been written on
- Text that only appears when hovering over the image

For now, we have decided to go with text that only appears when hovering over the image. This is so that the page is not cluttered
with lots of text, and not having very much text lets the first impression for viewers be something like "Wow, look at all of these 
pictures!" and not "Ew, why is there so much text here? I didn't come here to read, I came here to look at pretty pictures...".
