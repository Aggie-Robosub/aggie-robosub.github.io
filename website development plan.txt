This file is for creating a planned structure for each of the HTML files in this repository.
This will make it easier to have an idea of how to use CSS to interact with each file, as they will all be slightly different.

# history.html
Plan
1) create sections for previous iterations of the robosub
    - poseidon
    - pogenII
    - Seahorse
2) sections contain a description of that submarine, when it was created, any functionality it had, and the development cycle
    - we only have one image for poseidon and pogenII, so can only include one image for each previous sub sadly

Structure
- create containers for each previous sub
    - have text, that describes the sub
    - have an image of the sub



# gallery.html
Plan
1) organize images of all 'eras' of the robosub team into their own sections within the page
2) the images will display descriptive text about them, when they are hovered over with the mouse
    - this is to make it more interactive, and for any text to not take up any screen space that images should have instead :)

Structure
- create a container for each 'era'
    - Have text, which is the name for that era. (ex. "pogenII submarine")
    - create containers, to be placed next to each other, which contain both images and text inside them
        - text is invisible until image is hovered over
        - image becomes transparent when hovered over, with a transition



# current.html
Plan
1) have sections of the page describing the following aspects of the current project (not in order):
    - Development cycle
    - Tests
    - Deadlines
    - Submarine features
        - Hardware
        - Software
    - Competition requirements
    - Team members
2) Sections will have text about them, and images to the side if applicable

Structure
- create a table of contents, like how wikipedia has them for users to jump to different sections quickly
- create containers for each aspect of the project as listed above
    - one side of container contains text about that aspect
        - Header with name of aspect
        - paragraph with text about aspect
    - other side of container contains images
        - images will never be larger than 1/3 of the containers size horizontally
        - images will also be able to contain their own text, like gallery.html so as to not create too much text outside of themselves
