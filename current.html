        <h1>Submarine Features</h1>
        <p>
            Our submarine is equipped with various hardware and software required for it to perform autonomously underwater,
            and to meet competition requirements. To perform tasks on its own without human intervention, it must be equipped with
            electrical systems inside of itself that can take in sensory information and go on to feed instructions to various mechanically controlled
            hardware.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Hardware
        </h2>
        <p>
            The submarine can sense information about it's environment through the use of hydrophones, cameras,
            and temperature, pressure, and depth sensors. Hydrophones utilize a form of sonar to assist in mapping the local
            environment alongside cameras. Pressure and depth sensors help tell the submarine where it is within water, to help orient
            itself and stay underwater.
        </p>
        <p>
            To perform certain tasks, the submarine is also equipped with a torpedo launcher, a mechanical arm, a dropper,
            and propellers. These are all powered by electric motors.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Software
        </h2>
        <p>
            Multiple electrical circuits within the submarine feed information to the internal Raspberry Pi computer, which then
            will decide via our <b>copyrighted and highly confidential software</b> which instructions will be sent out. This
            interface between the Raspberry and the hardware happens thanks to the arduino onboard, which is capable of
            interpreting signals between all of the various circuits.

        <h1>Development Cycle</h1>
        <p>
            We deemed it necessary to have a testing schedule during our development cycle to ensure an efficient use of
            time and resources. Between the beginning and end of the 2025 spring semester, we will perform [NUMBER] tests, in scope
            of what we expect our submarine to be capable of when the test is scheduled.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Test 1: Flooding
        </h2>
        <p>
            The most important thing is to keep all of the internal components of the submarine safe while it is underwater
            (we don't want another Titan submersible situation on our hands). This test
            will include submersion of the submarine and inspection for damage. It will also include human-controlled testing of the
            Arduino and propeller interface, to see if the submarine can move around how it should.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Test 2: Sonar Testing
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order for our submarine to navigate autonomously, it must be able to sense it's environment. This test will
            ensure that the hydrophones onboard and the Teledyne computer system is working properly.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Test 3: Autonomous Functionality
        </h2>
        <p>
            This test is just making sure that our submarine can execute software and hardware functions on its own, without
            any manual control.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Test 4: Obstacle Navigation
        </h2>
        <p>
            The final test will be an obstacle course, attempting to replicate an environment similar to what is expected at the
            competition. At this point, our submarine will be very close to competition ready.
