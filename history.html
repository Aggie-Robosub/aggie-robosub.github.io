    <h1>Poseidon Submarine</h1>
    <p>
        The Poseidon is an autonomous underwater vehicle built by the
        Utah State RoboSub Team for the AUVSI RoboSub competition.
        Developed over three years (2013-2016) by 20 team members,
        Poseidon was fully modeled using SolidWorks CAD software.
        With extensive research and development,
        it became the team's lightest, most durable, and most advanced
        submarine.

    <h1>PoGenII</h1>
    <p>
        PoGenII, the second-generation AUV from the USU RoboSub Team,
        builds on the Poseidon model from previous years. Upgrades
        include improved vision recognition, enhanced electrical
        performance, and new features like a mechanical dropper and
        torpedo launchers. Its modular design makes PoGenII more
        adaptive and efficient for underwater navigation and tasks.

    <h1>Seahorse Submarine</h1>
    <p>
        Seahorse reflects our efforts to create a simple, adjustable
        vehicle with custom electronics and thruster controls. The
        Aggie Marine Robotics team set three main goals for the AUVSI
        Robosub competition: increasing testing time, completing the
        qualification maneuver, and redefining the teamâ€™s appearance
        and structure. These objectives were met through a series of
        testing rigs, each designed to achieve the goals and outperform
        previous USU Robosub entries.
