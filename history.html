        <h2>Poseidon Submarine</h2>
        <p>
            The Poseidon is an autonomous underwater vehicle built by the
            Utah State RoboSub Team for the AUVSI RoboSub competition.
            Developed over three years (2013-2016) by 20 team members,
            Poseidon was fully modeled using SolidWorks CAD software.
            With extensive research and development,
            it became the team's lightest, most durable, and most advanced
            submarine.

        <h2>PoGenII</h2>
        <p>
            PoGenII, the second-generation AUV from the USU RoboSub Team,
            builds on the Poseidon model from previous years. Upgrades
            include improved vision recognition, enhanced electrical
            performance, and new features like a mechanical dropper and
            torpedo launchers. Its modular design makes PoGenII more
            adaptive and efficient for underwater navigation and tasks.

        <h2>Seahorse Submarine</h2>
        <p>
            Seahorse reflects our efforts to create a simple, adjustable
            vehicle with custom electronics and thruster controls. The
            Aggie Marine Robotics team set three main goals for the AUVSI
            Robosub competition: increasing testing time, completing the
            qualification maneuver, and redefining the teamâ€™s appearance
            and structure. These objectives were met through a series of
            testing rigs, each designed to achieve the goals and outperform
            previous USU Robosub entries.
