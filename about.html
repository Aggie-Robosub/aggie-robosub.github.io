    The Aggie Marine Robotics club is a team of students at USU studying 
    Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science. 
    We are building an autonomous submarine capable of navigating an 
    obstacle course and performing various tasks, such as circling a 
    buoy, launching a torpedo at targets, depositing a payload, surfacing
    within a ring, and locating a target with sonar.
